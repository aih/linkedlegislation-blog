# Blog for LinkedLegislation.com

This is the content for blog.linkedlegislation.com. This was originally a Blogger (Google) blog, and I've migrated it to Jekyll hosted on GitHub Pages. The blog can be edited directly in the `_drafts` folder, and then moved to the `_posts` folder when it's ready to be published. It may also be edited using prose.io, a web-based editor that supports markdown. 

The blog is built using the [Beautiful Jekyll](https://beautifuljekyll.com/) theme. Details of how to add content and customize the theme can be found in the [README](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll/blob/master/README.md) for that project.
